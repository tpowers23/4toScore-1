            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Nowadays everybody loves to play games online with their friends, whether it be Call of Duty or a classic board game like Chess. 
                While people like to play games online, they also like to be competitive. 
                In response, we decided to incorporate both online multiplayer and competitiveness to the classic board game of Connect-4. 
                Our version of Connect-4 is called 4toScore and utilizes three different game modes: unranked, ranked, and play with friends. 
                With these features, people can have fun playing 4toScore casually, competitively, and a bit of both when playing with friends.</p>
